Auto-sizing-Story-Defect-Backlog-Card-Printer
=============================================

This app allows you to print Stories per Iteration, Backlog, or Defects per Iteration.  The print function auto-sizes the card to fit.  It is based on an app built by a Rally partner, Boost.

This app utilizes the print driver on your computer to dictate the size. The cards fill an A4 page in Landscape mode. To print 4 to a page fit 4 pages to a page in your print options and the stories will auto size to fit.
